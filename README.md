# Swift To Do List
A to do list app, code in swift, using swiftUI.
  
## Small story :speech_balloon:
I think that doing a to do list app is a good way to start how to create an app, using whatever swift or kotlin.  
So I wrote this to start my adventure on building apps.  
  
## Things you need to do :open_book:
* clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/michael21910/swift-todo-list.git
```
* open this using xcode, press "command + R" to run in simulator
  
## What will you get :icecream:
A nice to do list app that you can definitly add and delete to dos, also saves data if you close the app.
